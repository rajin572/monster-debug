            <h2>Question 1: Difference between local storage and session storage</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <h2>Question 2: Difference between global scope and block scope</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <p>The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default.
                This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized
                scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. <br> Block
                scoped variables: A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be
                accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable
                will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function.</p>

            <h2>Question 3: How does JavaScript Event loop work</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <h2>Question 4: How many ways can we get undefined javascript</h2>
            <h3>Answer :</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
                <li>Function with no return</li>
                <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
                <li>If return has nothing on the right will return undefined</li>
